### What is Project Euler?

> Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just
> mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a
> computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.

> The motivation for starting Project Euler, and its continuation, is to provide a platform for the inquiring mind to delve
> into unfamiliar areas and learn new concepts in a fun and recreational context.
